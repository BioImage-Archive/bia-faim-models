    role: curator
annotation_method: A machine learning-based framework was utilized to produce a first coarse annotation of nuclear contours. 
annotation_criteria: Only nuclei in focus were annotated, if parts of a nucleus were out of focus, only the part of the nucleus being in focus was annotated
annotation_coverage: All images were annotated
source_image: im001
annotation_confidence_level: Curators had 15 and 20 years of experience working in cancer pathology
spatial_information: N/A
transformatons: The rotation angle for each image is provided in a tsv file that contains the file level metadata
