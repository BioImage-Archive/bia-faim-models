          Accurate quantification of nuclear features is critical for the characterization of tumours. 
          This dataset contains annotated fluorescent images of cell nuclei from a normal human skin cell line, and from different tumour samples from cancer patients. 
          This dataset can be used to train nuclear image segmentation algorithms.
