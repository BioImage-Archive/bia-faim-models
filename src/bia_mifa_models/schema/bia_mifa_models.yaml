      Description of how the annotations were created. For example, were the annotations crowdsourced or expertly annotated, 
      produced by  a human or software, what software was used, when were the annotations created, 
      protocols used for consensus and quality assurance
    examples: 
      - value: >-
          A machine learning-based framework was utilized to produce a first coarse annotation of nuclear contours. 
          Then, a disease expert curated all annotations by editing, adding, or removing polygons. 
          Finally, an expert pathologist revised all image annotations and a final version of the annotations was curated.
      - value: >-
          Cell counts were performed manually by expert biologists. For cases difficult to quantify, 
          a vote including all experts was taken and annotations were corrected according to the majority view.
  
  annotation_criteria:
    description: Rules used to generate annotations
    examples:
      - value: Only nuclei in focus were annotated, if parts of a nucleus were out of focus, only the part of the nucleus being in focus was annotated
      - value: >-
          During cell counting, cell division was tracked using anillin localization. Mitosis was considered completed when anillin stop localising 
          at the contractile ring and re-entered the cell nucleus, at which point the dividing cell was considered two different cells.

      - value: >- 
          To characterize the quality of gold standard segmentation annotations, 
          we calculated the average and standard deviation performance of the three independent annotators 
          relative to the gold truth that was established by merging the triplets of manual annotations. 
          For the whole dataset this metric was 0.904±0.081
